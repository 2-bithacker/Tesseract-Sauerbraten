Description
---------------------------

This is a more simple map, took a few days to complete, more indoor areas than outdoor, etc.

The flow should be better than my previous map for DM games.

Loading This Map (Windows)
---------------------------

Unzip all the files in this zip file in your Sauerbraten/packages/base folder.

To load this map, open a DOS prompt, change to your Sauerbraten directory (where your sauerbraten.bat file is located) and type:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_castle_trap -w[width] -h[height]

I have a descent system, so I use this:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_castle_trap -w1600 -h1200

You can use a lower resolution to get better framerates, for example:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_castle_trap -w800 -h600
sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_castle_trap -w640 -h480

Try different resolutions to find what works best with your system.

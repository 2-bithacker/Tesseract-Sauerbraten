Howto install:
Simply unzip to your q4base folder where your Quake IV install is located.

This set was meant to be larger but due to lack of time and a bit of
lost interest for this set I decided to release it as it is now.
Some stuff should have been tweaked more but as I said 
I won't and will just release it in it's current state instead.
I sure will try to release more sets in the future tho.

Feel free to edit the textures and make additions in any way that suits you.
Have fun.

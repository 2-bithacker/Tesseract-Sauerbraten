Release Date:	18/10/05
Credits:	Special thanks to INIQUITOUS and LivingTarget for their feedback.
Software Used:	All the skyboxes were generated using TerraGen, some were modified in Paint Shop Pro 7.

This texture package contains a set of 13 different 6-sided skyboxes.  You're free to modify and use them for non-commercial use only, as long as you give credit in the map's readme file.  TerraGen is available from: http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen

Important
-----------------------------------------
The texture package itself is only meant for convenience - please do not use the textures directly from the package, instead put them in your map's MyLevel package.  If you use the textures straight from the file it will result in a 54MB extra download for anyone downloading your map.  This article tells you how to align skybox textures properly: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Terragen

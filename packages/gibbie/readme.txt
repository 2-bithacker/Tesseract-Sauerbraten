CONTENT INFORMATION:

A Quake idBase inspired normalmapped texture set. For use in custom 
maps for Quake 4, Doom 3, or any engine that they look good in. Feel free to 
use them in your map or mod, but don't forget to credit me (and please send me 
a note).

This set includes material definitions for the Doom 3/Quake 4 engine, including 
entity recolouring, glowmaps, alphatest etc. There are lots of metal panels, 
light textures which can be custom colored, floor textures in three different 
colors, a few decals with symbols, crates, a twall tech texture and qcomp 
textures. All textures are created completely from scratch.

A quick note about the light textures: It is recommended that you put a flare 
patch in front of the light texture. You should give the light texture and the
flare patch the same color value. I found that a brightness value of around 128
gives the most realistic results.

INSTALLATION:

For Quake 4: Just unzip idbase.pk4 to \Quake 4\q4base. In Q4Radiant load the 
textures by using the Media browser.

CONSTRUCTION:

Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Maya 6.5.

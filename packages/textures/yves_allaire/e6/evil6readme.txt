[Description]
Quake 3: Arena texture set in a sci-fi industrial space station
theme. Of course also for Cube Engine!

[Usage]
The shader files are seperated so you can easily edit them and
copy/paste them into your own shader file for release of your maps.

[Thanks]
Maj (http://maj.gamedesign.net/) for helping me with the .shader
files. You the man! :)
(This file isn't included in this zip, just because Cube Engine 2 isnt using such thing)

Bal (http://www.planetquake.com/bal) for the help on how quake3
specific textures are used, since I cannot test them in a map editor.
(Maybe when they make a Mac Q3 editor!! ;)
Everyone who had kind words to say about my other texture sets and
the folks at the Quake3World.com Level Editing Forum.
Everyone who has used/will use our textures in their maps. This is why
We make them. :)

[Stuff]
Sorry for the lack of CTF textures, I (Yves Allaire) just didn't have enought time
to make a decent set of them. And the ones I did make didn't turn out
too good. :\ Maybe next time.

If you use any of the textures please email us with the url to some
screenshots if possible. We really would like to see what uses mappers
have made of them.

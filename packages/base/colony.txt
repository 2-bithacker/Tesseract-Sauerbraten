Thanks so much Philip K for allowing the Quadropolis community to use your textures (http://philipk.net/) (http://quadropolis.us/node/3163) and to Skur for providing them to us.

Thanks goes to DokoDog, PepsiLight and Redon for contributions along the way, as well as Lokio, Swatllama, and Harsh for playtesting.

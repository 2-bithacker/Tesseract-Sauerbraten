Gorans Lava Set by goran svensson for Marathon Infinity 
================================================================================
I couldn't find any license for these textures, but almost all third-party texture packs for the Marathon games are freely usable for non-commercial purposes.

For clarity's sake, I renamed the pack from "Lava" to "spht" so no one blunders upon this folder when trying to mod sauer's lava texture.

You can find the full original download for this pack at:

mm-texture readme.txt

Listed below are the various source material websites I used for creating my "mm-textures" for the SAUERBRATEN engine/game.

All sources I used claimed the textures are free to use for non-commercial use. Each website has there own way of wording it, so if your interested, visit their sites.

http://www.mega-tex.nl/textures.php

None of the textures were "just copied and renamed". All were modified / layered / enhanced / pieced together by me.

Feel free to use my "mm-textures" any way you want, just please give me credit in your readme file.

Enjoy!

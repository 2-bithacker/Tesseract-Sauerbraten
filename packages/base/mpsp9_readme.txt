Hello to the Sauerbraten community!

I have a new single player SAUERBRATEN map pack called "Private Stan Sauer: Run n' Gun". If you've played any early mpsp series maps, you'll know what to expect!

This is a rather large download, approximately 25mb. The map pack contains the following:

1. (3) single player maps (mpsp9a, mpsp9b, mpsp9c)

2. 200+ new MitaMAN textures (including normal and spec maps) along with a few new and reworked textures from the loopix, noctua, and g-pack texture collections.

3. Mask textures for several of the mitaman models included from the original "Army of One" (mpsp6) map pack.

4. New doors, fence, elevator and floor board mitaman models.

5. Several DCP models (light, grates, switch, etc...) that were not part of any CUBE or Sauerbraten release.

6. A texture/model config template (mpsp9_template.cfg) to make it easy to use the new textures / models in your own map.

I tried to make the textures as "real world looking" as possible. They should prove very useful for modern-day as well as RPG type maps. The textures are high resolution, most 512x512, and scaled down to half or quarter size in the map configuration to maintain detail.

If you like more "shiny-plastic" looking textures change the following setting in the map configs:

from: setpixelparam 1 2 2 2

to: setpixelparam 1 4 4 4

CG Textures were my main source of raw texture material. Check the site out here:

Unless you have a high end video card, I suggest lowering the game resolution to 800x600 or 640x480. The maps were mainly tested on a 3.2GZ single core / 1.5 Gig ram / ATI 2600XT 512mb vid card @ 1024x768 resolution with all shader details up full. It even ran "OK" on a 2.5GZ single core / 1 Gig ram / nVidia G4mx 32mb (with all shaders off, very ugly!).

This map will push your system hard in some areas. There are many explosions, items that move, outdoor water areas, and elevators. I used most of what the engine has to offer map builders.

Take care of what you shoot at! Sometimes you'll find stuff after an explosion - BOOM!

Extract the "mpsp9_final.zip" file into your Sauerbraten folder (not "packages" folder). Some of the files from the original mpsp6 (Army Of One) map pack will be over-written. Don't worry, it's just improved model textures and md2 configs.
YOUR SAUERBRATEN INSTALL WILL NOT GET MESSED UP!

ALL NEW TEXTURES ARE IN THE packages/mpsp9 FOLDER IN THEIR OWN SUB-DIRECTORY.

To play the map, open the console, type "sp mpsp9a" (without quotes) and press enter. Then Run, Gun, and have fun!

Special thanks to all the content creators for the existing Sauerbraten assets I used in this map. And of course, extra special thanks to the developers of this outstanding game engine.

Any feedback on this map would be great.

Map's Story:

  Long ago, before the deathmatch was considered as a legal sport, a war raging for conquer
Identi planet took place in the Estrada system. During this war the human race built a
base of operations in the close small Avarax planet, and with it the Feather War Factory,
destined to supply the soldiers with vehicles, equipment and of course, weapons.

  After the war finished, the Feather War Factory had some legal issues and went down like
an extinct eagle. The factory closed, and the owner, desperated and without money, heard
about this so called "deathmatch arenas", so he supplied the processing and storage
facility of the factory (aka KatreZ) for deathmacth matches.

Developer Notes:

- I really, awfully suck at picking up names for my creations. The only things I can pick
  are about something that the name reminds me, or the theme of it, but for this one, I
  picked the first incoherent thing that came up in my mind, and that's why KatreZ.

- Since mappers aren't perfect, neither am I, this map could have some graphical bugs or
  regarding to gameplay too. So for that, feedback to my mail regarding this point will
  be very apreciated, also any opinion in general about the map will be apreciated.

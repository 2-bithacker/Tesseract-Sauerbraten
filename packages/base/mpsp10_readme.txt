Hello to the Sauerbraten community!

I have a new single player SAUERBRATEN map called "Private Stan Sauer: THE SERIOUSLY BIG VALLEY". If you've played any early mpsp series maps, you'll know what to expect!

This is a rather large map to explore, so you can expect about 45 minutes non stop action.

If you like more "shiny-plastic" looking textures change the following setting in the map configs:

from: setpixelparam 1 2 2 2

to: setpixelparam 1 4 4 4

Unless you have a high end video card, I suggest lowering the game resolution to 800x600 or 640x480. The map was mainly tested on a 3.2GZ single core / 1.5 Gig ram / ATI 2600XT 512mb vid card @ 1024x768 resolution with all shader details up full. It even ran "OK" on a 2.5GZ single core / 1 Gig ram / nVidia G4mx 32mb (with all shaders off, very ugly!).

This map will push your system hard in some areas. There are many explosions, items that move, outdoor water areas, platforms and elevators. I used most of what the engine has to offer map builders.

Take care of what you shoot at! Sometimes you'll find stuff after an explosion - BOOM!

To play the map, open the console, type "sp mpsp10" (without quotes) and press enter. Then have some SERIOUSLY BIG FUN!

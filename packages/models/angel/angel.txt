These models were released with the QuakeCon2000 models contest.
And I (Bill Brooks)
My website FPS http://fps.brainerd.net/
My email bbrooks@brainerd.net
Took the md3 files and all the shaders textures sounds and repacked them up so you can use them.
The email address for the authors may not work at this time as they are 1 year old and I didn't email them to find out.
But if you use these models please give them credit for there work in your readme for the map.
This is only right thing to do..
I could care less if you give me any credit for my work in repacking them..

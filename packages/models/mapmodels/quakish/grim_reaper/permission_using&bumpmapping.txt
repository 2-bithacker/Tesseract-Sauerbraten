    Dear Barry Collins,

    I've made a map with a non-commercial game called Sauerbraten (look at "sauerbraten.org" for more info) and would like to use some of your models (Adamantius, Vehementi and The Grimoire Confligere). This map  has a fair chance to get into an official release of the particular game, but of course with such beautifull models added, it would increase the experience of being on a nice looking map.
    I'm not sure if you truly are the author of those models, as the email address and website stated in the readme-file, went down a long time ago.

    So I would actually like to ask, am I allowed to use (and include) them into the map's zip file and finally, into the release of this game?
    I would also like to ask, am I allowed to add bump-mapped textures (based on the original skin) to the models, to make them look even better?

    If necessary, I will put down your name inside the map's configuration file, so you would get the honour you deserve.

    Thank you for your time.

    With hopeful regards,

    Suicizer

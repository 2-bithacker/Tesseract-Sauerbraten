Hello Matthias Breuer,

My name is Mike Poeschl (aka MitaMAN) and as a hobby I create maps for freeware First Person Shooters such as CUBE and SAUERBRATEN (cube2). You can find it here:

http://wouter.fov120.com/cube/

I am requesting permission to use your "wooden box models" from "cratepack.zip" that I came across on this thread:

http://216.116.32.49/mg/forums/result.thread.php?qt=24402

There is no commercial value to the games. Just a bunch of mappers, modelers, and programmers having fun.

Of course full credit will be given to you in a "credits readme file".

Thanks for your time and consideration:

Mike Poeschl (MitaMAN)

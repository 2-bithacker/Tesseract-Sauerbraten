Title: Fanatic's Quake Map
Author: Marc A. Pullen
Website: http://fanaticalproductions.net

This is a small DM type of map using the bump mapped Quake style textures in the latest Sauerbraten engine release.

Unzip into your Sauerbraten/packages/base folder, and run it in the game by pressing the "~" key, then type: /load fanatic_quake

Should be good for 2-4 player DM games.

Enjoy!

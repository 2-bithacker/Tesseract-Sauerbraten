As long as I haven't got any answer on my question to Barry if the models can be release with a "BY NC SA"-license on it, this should do...

As I once found in the readme of a Quake3World map.
"- All costum textures, sounds and mapobjects in this map are property of their respective
  owners"

This means:

You are allowed;
- To use these models at any time for maps, mods, etc.
- To set up an own configuration-file which fits your particular map, mod, etc.

You are NOT allowed;
- To modify, copy or distribute the meshes or skins of any model.
- To publish the meshes or skins of any model as your own work or with an other license.

You should only publish the models (which should include BOTH files) if you stated these models are made by "Barry Collins" (in the readme or configuration-file of your map at least).

If your not feeling anything for this, contact him on his website "http://www.greymattercandy.com/".

Have a nice day,

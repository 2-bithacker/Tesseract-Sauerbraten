* Broken stuff that just needs to get removed:

glare
character shadows
old dynlight system

* Stuff that needs to be rethought carefully but definitely added back somehow

water reflections/refractions
transparent cubes
materials
grass?
depthfx/soft particles
postfx

* Stuff that needs to be added but subsumes old functionality

bloom (instead of the old glare stuff)

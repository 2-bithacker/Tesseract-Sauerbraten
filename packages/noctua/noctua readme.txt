------------------------------------------------------------

Normal maps were made using the nVidia plugin for Photoshop. Specular maps were "made by hand" using brightness / contrast filters. 

A texture config template (mpsp9_template.cfg) is included to make it easy to use the textures in your own map.


Enjoy!

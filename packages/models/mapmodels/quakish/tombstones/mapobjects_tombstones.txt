These tombstones are the first 5 of a series of tombstone models I will be doing.

Created in GMAX while deployed to Saudi Arabia to keep me busy, they each took a few hours
to map and skin...nothing major!  I hope you enjoy them, and please if you use them, give
credit!

Thank you Kat for doing the screenshots and testing for me while I was unable to run Q3A!

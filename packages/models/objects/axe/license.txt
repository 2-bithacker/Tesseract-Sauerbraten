End User And Seller Agreement

Turbo Squid, Inc. and its affiliates and related companies (collectively "TurboSquid"), operate turbosquid.com and gamasutraexchange.com (each referred to as "Website"). The terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between TurboSquid and you ("You" or "Your") regarding the terms on which TurboSquid offers You access to its Website and Service. Your use of the Website or Service constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

I. DEFINITIONS

1. "Client Application" refers to TurboSquid software available for download at the TurboSquid web site or any other authorized download site, which allows Members to browse, purchase, upload, and download all Content published at TurboSquid. Client Application also refers to any software application that allows Members to download, purchase, create, alter or otherwise modify Content for use within a video game.

2. "Content" refers to any material published at TurboSquid including but not limited to wire files, models, textures, plug-ins, video games, video game modifications, motion files, collections, packages, materials, scripts, shapes, custom UI skins, tutorials, frequently asked questions, words, music, films, images, and software.

3. "For Sale" includes all Content that requires a purchase of license rights, as distinguished from Content available for free download.

4. "Incorporated Content" refers to Content that cannot be extracted from an application or product and used as stand-alone Content without the use of reverse engineering tools or techniques. For avoidance of doubt, Incorporated Content is the use of Content that is not intended to allow further distribution of the Content outside of the application or product containing the Incorporated Content.

5. "Member" refers to any person who creates a user account at TurboSquid.

6. "Service" refers to transmission, license, or purchase of Content to and from TurboSquid via the TurboSquid Website, a Client Application, or any approved web portal either currently in existence or in the future.

7. "Valid Sale" refers to a sale of license rights in Content or other property via TurboSquid, where the appropriate share of proceeds is received by a Seller who published the Content. Content For Sale via TurboSquid which is returned is not an example of a Valid Sale.

8. "Seller" refers to the submitting individual or business who publishes Content at TurboSquid.

II. LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN SELLER AND MEMBER

A. License Grant for transmission of Content from Seller to Member

For any transmission of Content from a Seller to another Member, whether the transmission was the result of a license or free download, the following terms apply unless more restrictive terms are specified in the text description of the Content in compliance with the requirements for providing more restrictive terms set-forth below:

1. Ownership.

Unless explicitly provided for by a separate agreement, which separate agreement must be available to the Member and which must be subject to acceptance by Member before or at the point of sale, the Seller retains, subject to any license agreement between the Seller and TurboSquid, copyright in Content purchased or downloaded by any Member via TurboSquid. In using the TurboSquid systems, You agree that any additional EULA, license or Seller requirements inserted into Seller products that fail to inform clients of restrictions prior to purchase are invalid, void ab initio, and without effect as they relate to those purchases.

2. Valid License.

Any license rights relating to Content For Sale via TurboSquid are contingent upon the transfer of money from the Member to the Seller. All license rights terminate immediately and without notice if a sale is reversed for any reason.

3. Rights Granted.

For any Sellers who provide TurboSquid with any type of Content for free distribution or sale, the following terms apply:

Seller hereby grants to TurboSquid, and by the act of delivering Content to us, grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, license in any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, set prices for, sell, and distribute net proceeds from any sale, in whole or in part on Seller’s behalf; and to publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; (b) create and use samples of the Content for the purpose of demonstrating or promoting Seller products or services or those of TurboSquid; (c) use any trademarks, service marks or trade names incorporated in the Content in connection with Seller material; and (d) use the name and likeness of any individuals represented in the Content only in connection with Your material.

The Seller grants to the Member who either purchases license rights to Content via a Valid Sale, or downloads freely available Content submitted by the Seller, a non-exclusive, worldwide, license in any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, post, promote, license, sell, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; (b) use any trademarks, service marks or trade names incorporated in the Content in connection with Seller material; and (c) use the name and likeness of any individuals represented in the Content only in connection with Your material. The Member license to Content in this paragraph is limited to Incorporated Content. Such use or republication, including sale or distribution of Content that is not Incorporated Content is prohibited. For illustration, approved distribution or use of Content as Incorporated Content includes, but is not limited to:

(i) As rendered still images or moving images; resold as part of a feature film, broadcast, or stock photography.

(ii) As part of a game if the Content is contained inside a proprietary format and displays inside the game during play.

(iii) As Content published within a book, poster, t-shirt or other item.

(iv) As part of a physical object such as a toy, doll, or model.

4. Rights Not Granted.

Absent a written grant of rights greater than that contained in paragraph 3 above, all other rights or sub-divisions of rights generally included in copyright are excluded from this license and remain the property of Seller.

5. Resale.

The resale or redistribution by the Member of any Content obtained from TurboSquid, whether For Sale or freely available for download, whether part of a Valid Sale or not, is expressly prohibited unless it is Incorporated Content as licensed above.

6. Returned Content.

In the event a Member returns any Content, whether acquired by Valid Sale or freely available for download, all license rights granted herein terminate and the Member must immediately destroy any and all copies contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the Member.

B. GENERAL TERMS

In addition to the above terms that apply to certain contexts, the following terms apply to all types of Content.

This agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon written notice via email or regular mail. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to mean that a Seller may not submit or delete Content from the material submitted by such Seller as part of general maintenance of such Seller’s account.

3. Representations and Warranties.

Seller represents and warrants that: (a) the Content is Your original work, and contains no copyrighted material of any kind that Seller is not the exclusive owner of, including but not limited to: music and/or synchronization rights, images (moving or still) of any kind, writings of any kind, and model clearances/releases; (b) Seller has full right and power to enter into and perform this agreement, and have secured all third party consents necessary to enter into this agreement; (c) the Content does not and will not infringe on any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or moral rights; (d) the Content does not and will not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (e) the Content is not and will not be defamatory, libelous, pornographic, obscene or evocative of racial hatred of any kind; (f) the Content does not and will not contain any viruses or other programming routines that detrimentally interfere with computer systems or data; (g) the Content does not contain any material that, as a condition of use, requires additional license restrictions such as requiring the publication of source code or Content that limits commercial exploitation of Incorporated Content; and (h) all factual assertions that Seller has made and will make to us are true and complete.

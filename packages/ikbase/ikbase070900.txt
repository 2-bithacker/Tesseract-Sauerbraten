These textures, either standalone or as a part of a level, mod or other
product may be freely used and distributed on a non-commercial basis
via electronic media (Internet, FTP, BBS) only. Commercial use, ie. 
anything that involves any kind of payment from the user, is prohibited.
The only exception is including levels or mods that use these textures
on a magazine cover CD. This is accepted, given that the level designer
or mod author has also given their permission for the magazine to 
include their work.

These textures may also be freely modified by the user, or used as a
base for additional texture artwork. Any modified versions of the
textures remain my property, and the above restrictions still apply.

If you want to use these textures as a part of a commercial product, 
a non-exclusive commercial license can be possible.

# Tesseract: Suarbraten

Most of all this is NOT my work.  I made it off of a couple of forks.
The original tesseract: https://github.com/lsalzman/tesseract
The fork I made this off of: https://github.com/2-bithacker/tesseract-1
That is a fork of a fork by calinou.  The only difference is that this one has all the data files in it an precompiled binaries.  This one is extract and play.

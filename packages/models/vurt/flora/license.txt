Models converted from the "Skyrim Flora Overhaul" mod on NexusMods. Created by "vurt", converted by "Khorne" in 2012.
Further adjustments to textures and model parameters by "RaZgRiZ" for optimal size/quality ratio.

Permission for use explicitly granted by the creator for simple, non-commercial use. 

----------------------------------
If my new models are just for use for a mod to that game and no one is earning money from it, then you have my permission
to translate the later mod where everything is 100% my own from scratch.
If any trees are going to be distributed in a game (comes default in the game) that is for sale or a mod which someone 
is e.g receiving donations for, then we can discuss a price or a way to donate to me for the models.

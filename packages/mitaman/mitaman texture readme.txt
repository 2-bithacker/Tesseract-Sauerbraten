CG Textures was the main source of raw texture material used to make this map pack for the SAUERBRATEN engine/game. They also have some useful tutorials. Check the site out here:

http://www.cgtextures.com/

None of the textures were "just copied and renamed". All were modified / tiled / layered / enhanced / pieced together by me using Photoshop ver 7. Normal maps were made using the free nVidia plugin for Photoshop. Specular maps were "made by hand" using brightness / contrast filters. 

Some great tutorials can be found here:

You MAY use any of my new textures in your own Sauerbraten project. Any use of my textures outside of the Sauerbraten game/engine will require my permission.

A texture config template (mpsp9_template.cfg) is included to make it easy to use the textures in your own map.


Enjoy!

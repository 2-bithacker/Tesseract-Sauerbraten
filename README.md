# Tesseract: Sauerbraten

Most of all this is NOT my work.  I made it off of a couple of forks.
The original tesseract: https://github.com/lsalzman/tesseract
The fork I made this off of: https://github.com/2-bithacker/tesseract-1
The only difference between this one and that one is that this one is updated to accomodate the latest packages.


This also includes an installer script for debian-baased linux distros.  If you do not have a debian-based linux distro, you will have to do it manually, but if you have a debian-based linux distro, you can run `cd ~/Tesseract-Sauerbraten`, then `./install` to install it.
You can also undo the installation if it has failed.  To do that, run `cd ~/Tesseract-Sauerbraten` then `./uninstall` and that will uninstall it.

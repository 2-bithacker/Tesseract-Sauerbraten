description:	unzip the tris.md2 and skin.jpg files to cube/packages/models/ using 'full path information' (how is this
		option named exactly in the english version of winzip???)

		add the following lines at the END of cube/data/models.cfg

		loadmodel "pillar"
		mapmodel 1 5 0 0

		when editing a map, select a floor cube, hit the console key and type 'newent mapmodel XY' where XY has to
		be replaced by the correspondent number of the new mapmodel in your models.cfg

		hint: best used to support a lowered ceiling...

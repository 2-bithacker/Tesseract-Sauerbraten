description:	unzip the tris.md2 and skin.pcx files to cube/packages/models/ using 'full path information' (how is this
		option named exactly in the english version of winzip???)

		add the following lines at the END of cube/data/models.cfg

		loadmodel "tree2"
		mapmodel 2 9 0 0

		when editing a map, select a floor cube (in an area with enough space to place the tree!), hit the console
		key and type 'newent mapmodel XY' where XY has to be replaced by the correspondent number of the new mapmodel
		in your models.cfg

		hint: lol, place the tree near a elevated area, from where you can hop on top of it. /sniperMode=true 

copyright:	it's free to use for eveyone who likes to. if you want to use it for something else than cube, please drop
		me a line, i just want to know...

		new chance to make use of my pathologic creativity, since my musical carrier has come to a grinding halt...)

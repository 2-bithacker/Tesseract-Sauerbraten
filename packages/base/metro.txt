the tree mapmodel is made by WohSiesta from the Tomatenquark Discord (model was originally intended to be used on my map Earthstation)
//


//
the custom sounds are made by me, except the 'shredder' sound. sorry, but i don't remember where i downloaded this from. however, the original file is titled "Designed Circuits - Source Recordings - Paper Shredder.mp3", if that helps someone locate it.

//
the graffiti and holographic sign models are also made by me, and decorated with a free font called "Woah!", with some edits

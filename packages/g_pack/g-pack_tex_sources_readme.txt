Release Date:	01/11/05	
Software Used:	Photoshop 7


This package contains a set of 291 textures with multiple variations as .jpg and .tga files. Theme is mainly Metal/Indus/Science-Fiction but other tastes may be pleased too. All textures are from 512*512 to 1024*1024 and their respective opacity masks when required. You're free to modify and use them for non-commercial use only, as long as you give credit and you provide this .txt file or a download link for the original .zip file in the project's readme file. If you work onto an Unreal Engine-based application, an .utx file can be downloaded here (conditions of use are the same): http://fichiers.unreal.fr/unrealengine/g-pack_tex_utx.zip

Normal maps were made using the nVidia plugin for Photoshop. Specular maps were "made by hand" using brightness / contrast filters. 

A texture config template (mpsp9_template.cfg) is included to make it easy to use the textures in your own map.

Enjoy!

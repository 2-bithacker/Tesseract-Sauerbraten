Please note that these models act as a replacement to makkE's gutter_v and gutter_h models who had a z_fighting bug, these ones have been redone from scratch and are now in proper 3D instead of 2D for the old version.

For all materials in these folder, if they're used outside of AssaultCube, please e-mail me with some screenshots.

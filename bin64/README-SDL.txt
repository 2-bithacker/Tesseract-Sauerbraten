This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

The current version supports Windows, Windows CE, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, iOS, and Android. The code contains
support for other operating systems but those are not officially supported.

SDL is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to
several other languages, including Ada, C#, Eiffel, Erlang, Euphoria,
Go, Guile, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Lua, ML, Objective C, Pascal, Perl, PHP,
Pike, Pliant, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

This library is distributed under the zlib license, which can be found
in the file "COPYING".

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
More documentation and FAQs are available online at:

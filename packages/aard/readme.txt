Original textures made by Aardappel

aardf* : made from a photo I took, then made to tile
aardo* : made completely from scratch (photoshop mostly)
aardm* : made using a free texture base but modified unrecognisibly

All texture tile well.

These textures are completely free to use in any way you like,
including using them as base for others. I couldn't care less
if you credit me or not.

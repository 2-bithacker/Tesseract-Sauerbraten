A sumptuous assortment of exquisite textures in a variety of styles, from surreal to sketchy to painterly to pixelated 'n' glitched-up — most are a challenge to describe but tend to provoke smiles.

All Torley Textures are 512x512 in (lossless) PNG format and seamlessly tiling. Use 'em almost however you want — just don't resell as-is — and let me know if you make somethin' kewl with 'em. You can also get them in Second Life @ http://torley.com/here

I (Martin "arand" Werner) emailed Torley with a request to clarify the
"no-resell" clause, and the result was that the textures may instead used under
CC-BY-SA-3.0 without the "no-resell" clause, the end note of a longer email
conversation is quoted below:

Sorry I've been so slow to reply!

With your recommendation, I've updated the license to CC-BY-SA-3.0. So...

Yes!

Let me know how it goes.

Sauerbraten map: "reissen"
Created by SATAN!!!, and completed on June 1, 2008.
-----------------------------------------------------


This CTF/regen map was created mainly using Lunaran's excellent q4power texture set. The skybox used was created by Darc, found at the Wadfather site. Thanks Lunaran and Darc!

This map requires a build greater-than the "Assassin Edition" version of Cube2/Sauerbraten.

Thanks to the many helpful people who offered advice, answered questions, and provided encouragement, and to all the fine people in #sauerbraten channel on the QuakeNet IRC network.

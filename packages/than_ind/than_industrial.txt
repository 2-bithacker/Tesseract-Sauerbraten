This is the first release of my industrial(ish) textures. This initial release
contains walls, trims, floors and a small selection of lights. In this current state
it is pretty likely you will need to use other texture in conjunction with these to
obtain satisfactory results. There are few fancy detailed textures etc although I may
make some of these for a later release. The lights also need to be expanded greatly.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

You may not use any of these textures as a base for additional materials without first
contacting the author (than@planetquake.com) for permission. If you do make modified
textures or need to modify the shader files then PLEASE rename them too to avoid problems
later on.

There is also a Sky shader written for the Nebulah sky box by Darc Jedi which you can
obtain separately from www.telefragged.com/soup
